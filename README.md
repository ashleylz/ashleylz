# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashley Zhang

I'm a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at Johns Hopkins University with a strong interest in backend development, software systems, and machine learning — especially real-world applications like neural networks and computer vision. I'm always eager to take on new technical challenges. Currently, I'm deepening my understanding of AI through the Break Through Tech AI/ML Fellowship and continuing backend development work as a software engineering intern at Liberty Mutual.
